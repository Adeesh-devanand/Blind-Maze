# Blind Maze

## Project Overview

The application has **two** basic windows. A **menu window**, where a user will be able to **choose** from a 
selection of pre-made mazes, or **create** a new maze of his own. When a maze is selected, a **play/edit** window will
open up, where he/she will be able to make changes to the maze, or try solving the maze as a player. While in editing 
mode, he/she will be able to **add** or **delete** walls on the maze. 

The _project title_ is derived from the next part of the project, While in the player mode, they will start from
**any random place** in the map, with the goal of **getting to the outside**. 
_They will only be able to know the blocks within a one block radius of the character_, as if they were holding a torch.
When they move their character, their vision moves with them. The interesting part of the maze is that there will be a 
**monster** which will spawn in a random location, and which follows the user on seeing them. The game **gets over** 
when the user touches the monster, or gets out safely.

This game targets a community of computer users who feels like taking a **short break** from their work, or 
**seasoned gamers** who want to view maze games in a different light. It could be of someone who is looking for games 
which let them be the game master, with the whole **"creation"** aspect of the game.

For the past year I have been interested in **competitive coding**, and have been experimenting with various 
**graphing algorithms**. I believe this project is quite challenging, and meanwhile still doable. I also feel that
coding the "monster" in the game provides me with the perfect opportunity to further experiment with graphing 
algorithms.
